        <b> How can we help find the right car accident lawyer in Georgia?</b>
      </button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
          We have partnered with a variety of lawyers within the Atlanta area that specialize in motor vehicle, workers’ comp, and personal injury cases. Together, we provide them with the medical reports and necessary information so they can work on our people's cases. An important part of what we do is that we do not receive a referral fee from the attorneys we work with.<br><br> 

          Our focus is to provide people with the tools they need to get back to the life they had before their accident.

        <b>How soon after a car accident should I seek medical attention?</b>
      </button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
          After a car accident, it is super important to follow up with medical attention. A car accident can result in whiplash, back injuries, neck injuries, and other serious conditions. Not seeking medical care right away can worsen potential internal injuries within the body, so although you may feel fine after an accident, it doesn’t necessarily mean you are.<br><br> 

          Additionally, by seeking medical attention early on, you can use the diagnoses, medical reports, and treatments received for your accident case. They can be used as evidence, giving you a stronger advantage for your claim.<br><br>
          
          At Dominguez Chiropractic, we are prepared to lead people to the proper legal professionals and handle their car accident cases.
