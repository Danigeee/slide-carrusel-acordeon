          We have conducted two clinical trials that have shown MindBlend to be effective in delaying cognitive decline in older adults suffering from mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease.<br><br>

          Our initial clinical trial was conducted during a 12-month period using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating.<br><br>

          We found that MindBlend produced more favorable results when compared to a placebo. We also found that taking low oral doses was tolerated better than taking higher doses.<br><br>

          During our clinical trials, we found that the number of patients in the low-dose group did not worsen but remained constant, suggesting that taking MindBlend daily may help patients with dementia maintain their functional independence despite the progression of their disease.<br><br>

          On the other hand, the results of the clinical dementia rating showed that the number of patients in the low-dose control group was lower than that of patients in the placebo and high-dose groups.<br><br>

          The other clinical study we conducted was an in vitro model of C. elegans. Because of the simple and well-characterized nervous system of C. elegans, it is an ideal model for studying neural and cognitive processes.<br><br>

          We found that MindBlend provided significant protective effects against induced body paralysis, which we used as an indicator of cognitive impairment in this in vitro model. Our powder solution also showed that it has a high positive potential to reduce cognitive impairment compared to the Gingko Biloba and placebo control groups.<br><br>

          In conclusion, both clinical studies have shown MindBlend to be a promising option for cognitive impairment treatment in patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimerâ€™s disease, due to its good tolerability profile, its effectiveness in sustaining cognitive functions, and its slowing progression of cognitive impairment.

          We evaluated its effects with an in vitro model of C.elegans, due to the cardiovascular system of C.elegans being quite similar to humans in terms of inflammation, oxidative stress, and fat reduction. <br><br>

          The results of our clinical trial indicate that CardioBlend offers a protective effect against acute oxidative stress in C.elegans at different concentrations. We also noticed that our powdered solution showed a significant percentage of fat reduction (20%) at various concentrations and had a better response to oxidative stress, which could indicate a potential anti-inflammatory effect.
